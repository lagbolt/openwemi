# Examples
It is probably easiest to define the openWEMI entities through examples. Examples can be simple descriptions, diagrams, code, or however you wish to provide them. Feel free to add examples to this directory.

# Some ideas
## Japanese wood block prints
https://archives.library.wcsu.edu/omeka/items/show/1874
https://archives.library.wcsu.edu/omeka/items/show/1874 This is an archive with Japanese wood block prints. There will be multiple copies, and this one has comments at the item level. You can find more examples of the same print at:
https://ukiyo-e.org/upload/44bc86daa9793109f5f6abf3565a7890
One interesting thing is that some of these are "original" copies, and some are "copied copies", like the photo prints that museums sell.
## Pigment Database
https://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Forbes_Pigment_Database

A database of pigments. Among other interesting things, the entries in this database are housed in a few different archives. I haven't looked to see if there is overlap among them.

## Bodleian Ballads
See 'Bodleian Ballads' subdirectory.

# Files
## [dcmiWEMI.pdf](https://github.com/dcmi/openwemi/blob/main/examples/dcmiWEMI.pdf)
This is a view of the Dublin Core Metadata Terms as Work, Expression, and Manifestation. There are also resource relationships which have not yet been incorporated into the WEM. The file [`dcmiWEMI.ttl`](https://github.com/dcmi/openwemi/blob/main/examples/dcmiWEMI.ttl) is the input to the diagram and defines the entities as SKOS collections.
